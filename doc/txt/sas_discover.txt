SYNOPSIS
========

``sas_discover [-h] [--verbose] [--addr] [--devices] [--counters]``

DESCRIPTION
===========

``sas_discover`` displays the SAS topology from the host initiator(s), through
any SAS expanders up to the SAS targets. Each link usually represents a SAS
port connection, whether it uses one or more PHYs.  The number of PHYs per port
is explicitly shown if greater than one (eg. "--4x--" for a 4-PHY wide port).
Please note that by default, ``sas_discover`` tries to fold common devices
(like disks), like in the example below:

:-- 60 x end_device -- disk:
    60 x 1-PHY links, each connected to a SAS end_device target of SCSI type *disk*

Host initiators, expanders and end devices are labelled with the same name used
in sysfs. If `-v` is provided, more descriptive information will be displayed,
but the topology will stay folded whenever possible. ``sas_discover -v`` will
also print SES-2 subenclosure nicknames, which are useful to identify JBODs/SIMs
and external SAS switches connected to the topology.

Use `-vv` to unfold the topology and display more information (eg. model, size,
bay identifier in enclosure).

Use `-vvv` to display additional low-level information for each SAS end device.

Add `--addr` to also display the SAS address for each SAS component found in the
topology.

OPTIONS
=======

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit

  --addr         Print SAS addresses
  --devices      Print associated devices
  --counters     Print I/O counters


EXIT STATUS
===========

An exit status of zero indicates success of the command, and failure otherwise.
